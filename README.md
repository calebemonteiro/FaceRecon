# Face Expression Recognition (WIP)

Convulational Neural network using Keras and tensorflow-gpu. Network was trained from scratch using Nvidia's Gforce 2080 GTX.
this was based in challenge closed long ago in kaggle.

This is working in progress. Next steps are:
  - Deploy deploy model with Flask.

This implementation is educational only and is free to use.
