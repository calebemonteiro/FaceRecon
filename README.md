# Face Expression Recognition (WIP)

Convulational Neural network using Keras and tensorflow-gpu. Network was trained from scratch using Nvidia's Gforce 2080 GTX.
this was based in challenge closed long ago in kaggle.

Done:
  - Preprocessing Dataset and Image generation for batch training.
  - Model built (ref. https://gist.github.com/jonathanoheix/2d16f5a39443ed05b0ba1e04d90f569c#file-face4-py)

TODO:
  - Deploy deploy model with Flask.

This implementation is educational only and is free to use.
